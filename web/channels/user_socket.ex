  # Socket params are passed from the client and can

  # To deny connection, return `:error`.

  # See `Phoenix.Token` documentation for examples in

  # all active sockets and channels for a given user:
  #
  #     Artus.Endpoint.broadcast("users_socket:#{user.id}", "disconnect", %{})
  #
  # Returning `nil` makes this socket anonymous.
